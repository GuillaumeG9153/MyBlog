# Blender

In the different labs we learn how to create different type of shapes thanks to the exctract tools. We also learnt how to change materials and their colours.

Thanks to these labs I did these 3 3D creations : a launcher, my clio 1 car and my character that looks like a stonks version of Spirou.

**launcher**

I won't go deep in this lab since everyone has the same object at the end, but it's pretty cool so here is my launcher :

**Clio 1**

In this lab I wanted to create my own car : the famous Clio 1 !

This is the result :

*How I did this ?*

First of all I used this blue print of the car :

Then thanks to the exctraction tool I matched the side of my car with this blueprint and it camed like :

but it was only looking good on the side :

So, this I why I created an other shape which matched with the back of the car and I used a modifier called "Boolean" (here intersection) to change its shape like this :

Then I added a plate to make the windows and I changed the materials to red since my car is red and that's it.

**Spirou character**

Now this is the turn of my character !

As you can see it's like a mix of Spirou and the Stonks character.

To to that I added : spheres to do the buttons of the suit and vertices to change locally the colour (to do the black stripes).

I wanted to use my character in my unity game but I had issued with the skeleton (when I moved the arms the legs was moving too) and the time was running so I downloaded a new character on mixamo.
