          Lecture 4 : Let me introduce you Jonathan Grudin who is an American HCI researcher, he works as a principal design researcher at Microsoft and he is also a professor in the University of Washington Information School. He became famous since he received an award from the CHI Academy which is a group of people specialized in Human-Computer Interaction and since he is a pioneer of this field. As he worked on CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) he raised something that we will call later the “Grudin Problem” which explain why CSCW application fail and this is what we will deal with.

          Here are my ideas about AR :
Firstly I think AR is here to help us in our daily but I also think it has to be intuitive and look cool in order to be use often. My first Idea would be a kind of augmented mirror. Let me explain that : as the textile industry is one of most polluting one, some companies are trying a new system using pre-orders and then the company produces a number of clothes wich corresponds to the number of pre-orders.

          Lecture 10 : As you can see on the pictures I provided, Apple as well as Samsung have done pretty much the same innovations concerning the design of their smartphones. Firstly, and at the different of previous mobile phones, smartphones just had 3 maximum physical buttons at the bottom of their screen (without counting ones for the volume or the power). Then for the next generation the screen just got bigger (larger and longer), then this screen became borderless on his sides such as the Samsung galaxy s6 edge.

          In this Topic I will present you my Unity game named Floor is Lava 2k20. The game is separated in 4 rooms.
Here is the first one : This room is like a tutorial since it makes you understand that you need all collectibles in a room in order to remove the wall that is blocking you the access and that if you fall on the lava you respawn at the beginning of the zone.
